This repo is used as a template for creating new prototypes using the NHS Prototype kit.

You can edit this README file to add any useful details about running your prototype.

## Running the prototype

1. Install dependencies: `npm install`
2. Start the prototype: `npm start`
3. Open http://localhost:3000 in your browser

## Using Visual Studio Code

When you open this project in VS Code, you may see a message: *"Folder contains a Dev Container configuration file. Reopen folder to develop in a container"*.

**You can ignore this message.** You do not need Docker or to reopen in a container to run the prototype locally. Just use the steps above.

The Dev Container is optional as it is used for [GitHub Codespaces](https://github.com/features/codespaces) (cloud development). If you want to develop in a container on your own machine, you would need Docker installed, but that is not required for normal use.
