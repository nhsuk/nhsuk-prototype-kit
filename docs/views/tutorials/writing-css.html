        Writing CSS
      </h1>

      <p>The prototype kit uses SCSS syntax of <a href="http://sass-lang.com/documentation/file.SASS_REFERENCE.html#syntax">Sass</a> to write CSS.</p>

      <h2>Sass</h2>

      <p>Sass is an extension of CSS that gives a load of extra features useful in producing CSS for the mass of different devices and browsers.</p>

      <p>You can paste CSS into it without breaking it which is useful for prototyping.</p>

      <h2>Writing code</h2>

      <p>You write your Sass in <code class="app-code">app/assets/sass</code>, and it gets compiled into the CSS used in your page (found in <code class="app-code">/public/css</code>).</p>

      <p>There is already a CSS file included called <code>main.scss</code> which compiles into <code>main.css</code>.</p>
      
      <div class="nhsuk-inset-text">
        <p>Note that Sass files are identified by the <code class="app-code">.scss</code> extension.</p>
      </div>

      <p>Each time you make a change in <code class="app-code">main.scss</code> it will create a new version of <code class="app-code">main.css</code>. Make sure to write your css in <code class="app-code">main.scss</code> as anything you put in <code class="app-code">main.css</code> will get overridden.</p>
